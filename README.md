This is the repository for the final project for CS584 Machine Learning. Explore our collaborative effort by Nathan Loh and Nikolaus Schultze, dedicated to predicting COVID cases through machine learning algorithms. The repository includes implementations of diverse algorithms such as Tree Regression, Logistic Regression, Regular Regression, K-nearest neighbors, and two innovative combinations of these methods. With a focus on accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, our algorithms analyze a dataset containing symptoms and events related to COVID-19, providing valuable insights. Check out the code, algorithms, and comprehensive project reports to delve into the world of machine learning applied to real-world challenges.
